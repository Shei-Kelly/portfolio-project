              Palm wine is an alcoholic beverage created from the sap of various
              species of palm tree such as the ¬¥Raphia Palm¬¥. It is known by
              various appellations as matango,
              <br />
              mbuh, tumbu liquor, white stuff in Cameroon. It is found in many
              parts of Asia, Africa the Caribbean and South America.
              <br />
              Palm wine production by small scale farmers may promote
              conservation as palm trees become a source of regular household
              income that may economically be worth more than the value of
              timber sold.

              Today technology is becoming more and more widespread by the
              minute, even in Cameroon, where the need for a well-trained
              generation of scientists is crucial. Science, Technology,
              Engineering, and Mathematics, or STEM skills are important for the
              new workforce in any growing economy around the world, but as this
              technology spreads, it is not necessarily representing the needs
              of a large portion of the global population: women.
              <br />
              This means that a large portion of today‚Äôs and tomorrow‚Äôs
              technology for communication, transportation, and health (among
              many other domains) will be designed by men, unless we inspire
              more girls to study STEM topics now. ‚ÄúSTEM box‚Äù and ‚ÄúSTEM Your
              School‚Äù are projects that were started by Mrs. Bih Janet Shufor
              Fofang to increase the numbers of women in technology in Cameroon,
              and to give them more decision-making power in STEM. ‚ÄúSTEM Your
              School intends to create a huge impact in building self-confidence
              of both the STEM female teacher and female student at the same
              time,‚Äù

              A weather app lets you do that wherever you are, whenever you
              like. When testing weather apps, we spent most of our time
              evaluating the effectiveness of their design. An ideal weather app
              is visually pleasing and easy to use.
